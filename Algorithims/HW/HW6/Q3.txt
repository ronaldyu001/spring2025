In the study, “Microkernel-Based Web Architecture: Design & Implementation Considerations” by Vick Dini, he proposes a web architecture that utilizes the microkernel design to platform a “Multi-Paradigm Modular Web System.” 
The architecture flexibly considers module implementations that follow monolithic, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), or microservice architectures. 
Dini attempts to resolve several challenges that have arisen with the usage of microservices in this paper. 
His theorized microkernel would possess the following services: Dispatcher, Debugger, Monitor, Service Manager, Scheduler, Inter-Service Communication, and Memory Manager. 
These services supply the necessary minimum operations to run as a kernel but additionally include support for web services.
